### Vegetarian Checker
_Showing our users whether the grocery item they bought contains any non-vegetarian ingredients._

#### Process:
* Listen for a barcode inputted by the user
* Fetch from the Open Food Facts API the item corresponding to the user's barcode (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data)
* Display the image and name of product
* Create a table where we have ingredients and vegetarian status side-by-side
* Create visual queue for the user to be able to discern whether there are any non-vegetarian items in the ingredient list
